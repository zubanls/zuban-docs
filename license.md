# License

As ZubanLS is not open source, we need to generate revenue to sustain
development. It is entirely self-funded and does not accept outside investment.
Our goal is to offer free services to small businesses, educational
institutions, and non-commercial organizations, while enterprises contribute
through licensing.

We define small to medium projects as those with 50,000 lines of code or less,
roughly equivalent to 1â€“2 MB of Python source. Dependencies are not counted.
This means most data science users will likely qualify for free usage.

During the alpha period, all ZubanLS releases are available at a 100% discount.
Check [pricing](https://zubanls.com/pricing) for more information.

**You are permitted to use ZubanLS in your IDE or editor**. Licensing terms may
change in future releases. Companies may not offer services built on top of
ZubanLS without a license. For licensing inquiries, contact us at
info (at) zubanls.com.

## Activation

If you have received a license, activate it by copying the provided license
file to:

- Linux: `/home/<user>/.config/zuban/license.json`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\zuban\license.json`
- Mac: `/Users/<User>/Library/Application Support/zuban/license.json`

You will need to restart the language server, which usually requires restarting
your IDE or code editor.
