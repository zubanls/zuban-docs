# Activate your license

To activate your license, copy the license you have received to:

- Linux: `/home/<user>/.config/zuban/license.json`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\zuban\license.json`
- Mac: `/Users/<User>/Library/Application Support/zuban/license.json`

You will then need to restart the language server, which typically requires
restarting your IDE or code editor.
